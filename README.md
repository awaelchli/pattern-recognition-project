# Pattern Recognition Project

## MNIST Classification

The folder [`02/`](https://github.com/mariokaufmann/pattern-recognition-project/blob/master/02/) contains the code for MNIST classification with SVM and MLP. The results are presented in the final [report](https://github.com/mariokaufmann/pattern-recognition-project/blob/master/02/02-REPORT/Report-Project-02.pdf).

## Keyword Spotting

The main files for execution can be found in folder [`03/`](https://github.com/mariokaufmann/pattern-recognition-project/tree/master/03). A one-time preprocessing step is required in order to cut out the words from the documents. Read more about the preprocessing [here](https://github.com/mariokaufmann/pattern-recognition-project/blob/master/03/).

## Signature Verification

Our implementation of signature verification can be found in folder [`04/`](https://github.com/mariokaufmann/pattern-recognition-project/tree/master/04/SignatureVerification).
